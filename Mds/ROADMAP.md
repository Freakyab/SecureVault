# SecureVault — Development Roadmap

Track progress for building the **SecureVault** password manager as an **Expo (React Native)** app, using the UI/UX in the [`screenshots/`](../screenshots) folder as the design reference.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-14 (Run 14)  
**Overall status:** 🟡 In progress — **49%** project-wide (added **Phase 8 — Modern Animation & UX**: an advanced motion track for gesture-driven interactions, shared-element transitions, delight animations, and reduced-motion accessibility)

> **Status (2026-06-14, Run 14):** Added **Phase 8 — Modern Animation & UX** as a second polish track
> (18 tasks) that extends Phase 7's token + motion foundation toward a best-in-class feel: gesture-driven
> list/sheet interactions (swipe actions, drag-to-reorder, velocity-aware sheets), shared-element + scroll-
> driven screen transitions, delight/feedback animations (Lottie success, animated rings/strength meters,
> celebratory moments), ambient motion (animated gradients, shimmer→content morphs, spring tab bar), and a
> dedicated accessibility + performance pass (reduce-motion variants, 60fps UI-thread budget, timing audit).
> Adding the new scope moves the project-wide denominator to **168** tasks; overall → **49%** (82/168).
> The Pre-Phase 3 gate is unaffected (still 58%). New milestone **M6 — Living UI** tracks the track.
>
> **Status (2026-06-14, Run 9):** **Premium UI proof-of-concept (CRED-style blend).** Evolved the
> `src/theme` tokens toward a premium dark look — deep aubergine background, violet accent, and new
> `glass` + `gradients` token sets (resolved per scheme via `getTheme`). Added a reusable
> `components/ui/PressableScale` (Reanimated press-scale + haptic) and redesigned the **Dashboard**
> screen: glow-gradient backdrop, glass header/search, a 3-stat summary card with count-up health
> score, premium category tiles, fade-in + staggered entrances, and a gradient Security-Health hero.
> `useTheme` is now dark-first so the premium look holds on light-mode devices. Completed **7.13**
> (durations) and **7.15** (haptic map); **7.14/7.20/7.21** advanced (partial). Lint clean; no new
> `tsc` errors. Phase 7 → 27% (6/22); overall → 52% (78/150); Pre-Phase 3 gate unchanged at 50%.
>
> **Status (2026-06-14, Run 8):** Completed **Phase 7.4** — `useTheme()` now resolves the full
> Fold-style token object (`colors`, `spacing`, `layout`, `radius`, `typography`, `shadows`, `motion`)
> from `src/theme/getTheme(scheme)`, and `useHaptics()` provides named feedback actions for press,
> success/warning/error, selection, card expansion, and pull-to-refresh. Updated starter themed
> helpers to consume `theme.colors`. Lint clean; `tsc --noEmit` is still blocked by pre-existing
> starter tab/SymbolView type issues and missing Jest globals. Phase 7 → 18% (4/22); overall → 51%
> (76/150); Pre-Phase 3 gate unchanged at 50%. Next: reusable UI kit (7.5–7.12), starting with
> `Button`.
>
> **Status (2026-06-14, Run 7):** Started **Phase 7 foundation (7.1–7.3)** — built the Fold-style
> design-token system under `src/theme/` (`colors.ts`, `spacing.ts`, `radius.ts`, `typography.ts`,
> `shadows.ts`, `animations.ts`) with a `getTheme(scheme)` barrel and a `Theme` type. Light + dark
> color schemes share token names; brand accent stays `#5F61F6`. Lint clean, no new type errors.
> Phase 7 → 14% (3/22); overall → 50% (75/150); Pre-Phase 3 gate unchanged at 50%. Next: 7.4
> `useTheme`/`useHaptics` hooks, then the UI kit (7.5–7.12).
>
> **Status (2026-06-14, Run 6):** Added **Phase 7 — Premium UI overhaul (Fold-style)** as a parallel
> polish track (22 tasks) plus a [Fold-style design-token reference](#fold-style-design-tokens-phase-7).
> The track adopts the Fold Money design philosophy (clarity, space, motion, depth, consistency) via a
> centralized token system, a reusable UI kit, and Reanimated/haptics motion — without cloning Fold.
> Adding the new scope moves the project-wide denominator to 150 tasks; overall → 48% (72/150).
> The Pre-Phase 3 gate is unaffected (still 50%).
>
> **Run 5:** Verified the Phase 2 Dashboard and Vault screens against the
> shipped, data-wired implementations (`dashboard.tsx`, `main-vault.tsx`, `bottom-nav.tsx`):
> greeting header, 6-category stat cards, Manage/Recently-Used sections, pill tab bar, vault
> shield header, search, category chips, credential rows, security-alert card, and empty
> states are all live. Phase 2 → 61%; overall → 56%; Pre-Phase 3 gate → 50%.
>
> **Run 4:** Credentials are encrypted at rest with AES-256-GCM (PBKDF2-SHA256, 120k iterations).
> Legacy plaintext vaults migrate on first unlock. The Generator tab is live with
> length/charset controls and save-to-vault. Categories are centralized in
> `constants/categories.ts`. Wrong-password, corrupt-vault, and storage-full errors surface
> actionable messages.

Counts every `- [ ]` / `- [x]` task in this file. **Recalculate** after checking boxes:

```powershell
# PowerShell (Windows)
$total = (Select-String -Path ROADMAP.md -Pattern '^- \[[ x]\]').Count
$done  = (Select-String -Path ROADMAP.md -Pattern '^- \[x\]').Count
"$done / $total = $([math]::Round(100 * $done / $total))%"
```

```bash
# macOS / Linux

## Vision

A mobile password manager that lets users:

- Store and organize credentials by category
- Generate strong passwords with configurable rules
- See password health (strength, reuse, breaches)
- Keep data secure with local encryption (and optional cloud sync later)

## Fold-style design tokens (Phase 7)

Premium "Fold Money"–inspired token set for the [Phase 7 UI overhaul](#phase-7--premium-ui-overhaul-fold-style). Used to feed `theme/colors.ts`, `spacing.ts`, `radius.ts`, `typography.ts`, `animations.ts`. Brand accent stays the SecureVault purple (`#5F61F6`); accent should occupy **<10%** of any screen.

**Neutral palette**

| Token | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Background | `#F7F8FA` |
| Surface | `#FFFFFF` |
| Surface alt | `#F1F3F5` |
| Border | `#E9ECEF` |
| Primary text | `#121212` |
| Secondary text | `#6C757D` |
| Muted text | `#ADB5BD` |

**Semantic colors**

| Token | Value |
|-------|-------|
| Primary accent | Brand (`#5F61F6`) |
| Success | `#2ECC71` |
| Warning | `#F4B400` |
| Error | `#FF4D4F` |
| Info | `#4A90E2` |

**Spacing (8-pt)** · `xs 4 · sm 8 · md 12 · lg 16 · xl 24 · xxl 32 · xxxl 48` — card padding 20–24, screen h-padding 20, section v-spacing 24–32.

**Radius** · `chip 12 · button 16 · card 20 · sheet 24 · floating 28`.

**Typography** · Display 32/Bold · Heading 24/SemiBold · Title 20/SemiBold · Body 16/Regular · Caption 13/Medium · Label 11/Medium.

**Motion durations** · tap 120 · button 180 · card expand 250 · navigation 300 · modal 350 (ms).

**Rules:** avoid pure-black backgrounds, low-saturation grays only; prefer whitespace over dividers; subtle shadows over heavy color; no arbitrary radius values.

## Phase 0 — Foundation

**Goal:** Align on scope and prepare the codebase before UI work.

### Tasks

- [x] **0.1** Confirm product scope for v1 → **offline-only** for v1
- [x] **0.2** Choose styling approach → **StyleSheet + `securevault-theme.ts`**
- [x] **0.3** Choose icon library → **lucide-react-native**
- [x] **0.4** Use the [`screenshots/`](../screenshots) folder as the read-only design reference
- [x] **0.5** Document v1 feature list (must-have vs nice-to-have)
- [x] **0.6** Set up branch strategy / issue labels if using GitHub

### v1 feature checklist (suggested defaults)

**Must-have**

- [ ] Onboarding (first launch) — UI + persist flag
- [ ] Dashboard with category summary — mock data
- [ ] Vault list + search + category filters — mock data
- [ ] Add / edit / delete credential
- [x] Password generator + save to vault *(Generator tab + Add Credential prefill — Run 4)*
- [ ] Basic health score (weak + reused passwords)
- [x] Local encrypted storage (AES-GCM + PBKDF2, AsyncStorage + SecureStore) *(Run 4)*
- [ ] Master password (setup + unlock screens; biometrics deferred)

### Website branding & credential preview (v1.1)

**Goal:** Save credentials by **website + username + password**, then show the **site logo** in the avatar with **blurred** username/password preview in lists.

- [ ] **W.1** `website` field on credential (e.g. Instagram) + optional URL for domain
- [ ] **W.2** Favicon/logo in avatar via Google favicon API (`services/site-branding.ts`)
- [ ] **W.3** Quick-pick chips for popular sites on entry form
- [ ] **W.4** Live **vault preview** before save on entry screen
- [ ] **W.5** Vault / Home / Health lists use `CredentialListItem` (logo + blurred cred lines)
- [ ] **W.6** Migrate older vault entries (`title` → `website` on unlock)
- [x] **W.7** Cache logos offline for faster load *(expo-image disk cache + per-domain status map — TASK-006)*
- [x] **W.8** Custom logo upload per credential *(expo-image-picker + customLogoUri — TASK-007)*

**Nice-to-have (defer)**

- [x] Breach monitoring (Have I Been Pwned API) *(k-anonymity Breach Monitor — TASK-011)*
- [ ] Import / export vault
- [ ] Cloud sync
- [ ] Sharing credentials
- [ ] Browser extension

### Definition of done

- Decisions recorded in **Open decisions** (below) are filled in
- Team agrees on v1 scope

---

## Phase 1 — Design system & app shell

**Goal:** Replace Expo starter with SecureVault structure, theme, and navigation—screens can be placeholders.

### Tasks

- [x] **1.1** Add `constants/securevault-theme.ts` with **light + dark** palettes *(`src/constants/securevault-theme.ts` bridges to `src/theme/colors.ts`)*
- [x] **1.2** Load app fonts via `expo-font` — **keep current fonts**: system sans for body + Playfair Display serif headings (`@expo-google-fonts/playfair-display` in `app/_layout.tsx`)
- [x] **1.3** Update root `app/_layout.tsx` (theme provider, fonts, splash) *(`src/app/_layout.tsx` wires fonts, splash, providers, navigation theme, and status bar)*
- [x] **1.4** Create route groups: `(auth)` (onboarding/unlock/setup), `(tabs)` (dashboard/vault/my-vault/generator/health/settings) + `entry/[id]` credential detail *(custom `BottomNav` kept; `add-credential`/`change-password` remain root routes)*
- [x] **1.5** Implement auth gate (onboarding flag in `expo-secure-store`) *(`src/services/onboarding.ts` + auth entry resume setup after onboarding)*
- [x] **1.6** Build custom **pill tab bar** (blur on iOS, themed on Android) *(`src/components/vault/bottom-nav.tsx`)*
- [x] **1.7** Wire tab routes: Home, Vault, Generator, Health *(Dashboard, Vault, Generator, Health, Settings wired via `(tabs)` routes + `BottomNav`)*
- [x] **1.8** Create shared UI primitives: `Button`, `Card`, `Input`, `Badge`, `Progress`, `Screen` *(`src/components/ui/primitives.tsx` + `src/components/ui/index.ts`)*
- [x] **1.9** Remove default Expo Explore tab *(deleted unused starter `components/app-tabs.tsx` + `app-tabs.web.tsx` with their Home/Explore triggers — app uses the custom `BottomNav`)*
- [x] **1.10** Configure status bar / safe areas (`Screen` + `SafeAreaView`) *(root `SafeAreaProvider`, `StatusBar`, safe-area-aware screens, and shared `Screen`)*
- [x] **1.11** `SecureVaultThemeProvider` — all screens use `useSecureVaultTheme()` *(`SecureVaultThemeProvider` wraps the existing theme context; `useSecureVaultTheme()` aliases the resolved token hook)*

### Definition of done

- App launches into onboarding or tabs based on auth state
- All five main areas are reachable via navigation
- Theme matches prototype purple palette on all shells

---

## Phase 2 — UI screens (mock data)

**Goal:** Pixel-close layouts using static data—no real vault yet.

### 2.1 Onboarding

- [x] Hero illustration / image area
- [x] Title, subtitle, step indicator dots
- [x] Primary CTA (“Get started” / multi-step)
- [ ] Secondary “Log in” link (placeholder)
- [ ] Persist “onboarding complete” on CTA

### 2.2 Dashboard (Home)

- [x] Header with greeting / user area *(menu + avatar header, “Hello, SecureVault” greeting — `src/components/screens/dashboard.tsx`)*
- [x] Category stat cards (6 categories, theme-aware tints) *(CategoryCard grid from `CREDENTIAL_CATEGORIES` with live counts)*
- [x] “Manage password” + Recently Used sections *(MANAGE PASSWORDS grid + RECENTLY USED / SEARCH RESULTS list)*
- [x] Floating pill tab bar integrated with tabs layout *(`BottomNav` pill bar on all tab screens)*

### 2.3 Vault

- [x] “My Vault” header + shield branding *(shield brand tile + “Main Vault” header — `src/components/screens/main-vault.tsx`)*
- [x] Search input (UI only) *(live `filterCredentials` search field)*
- [x] Category chips: All, Social, Mail, Design, Finance *(shared `CATEGORY_FILTERS` chips + Active/Favorites/Archived view chips)*
- [x] Credential list rows (title, username, category, icon) *(`CredentialRow` with logo, copy, favorite, risk badges)*
- [x] Security alerts section (compromised, reused) *(SECURITY PULSE alert card → Health)*
- [ ] “Import vault” entry point (UI stub) *(import lives in Settings backup flow — TASK-012)*
- [x] Empty state when no items *(`EmptyState` with view-aware messaging)*

### 2.4 Generator

- [x] Generated password display + copy button
- [x] Length slider *(stepper + presets 12–32, Roadmap 3.14)*
- [x] Toggles: uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols
- [x] Strength meter (weak → strong) with shield icon states
- [x] Regenerate control
- [x] “Save secure password” CTA (wired to vault) *(prefills Add Credential — 3.15)*

### 2.5 Health

- [ ] “Password Health” header
- [ ] Health score ring or large score display
- [ ] Breakdown cards: Safe, Risk, Compromised, Refused (static)
- [ ] Recommendations list (static)
- [ ] Actionable list linking to affected entries

### 2.6 Entry detail (new screen)

- [ ] View mode: site, username, password (masked), notes, category
- [ ] Edit mode with form validation (UI)
- [ ] Show / hide password, copy actions
- [ ] Delete with confirmation dialog

### Definition of done

- Every screen in the prototype has a React Native equivalent
- Mock data lives in `constants/mock-data.ts` or similar—easy to remove later
- No crashes on iOS and Android (Expo Go or dev build)

---

## Phase 3 — Local vault & security

**Goal:** Real data persistence and cryptography—app is usable offline.

### Data model

- [x] **3.1** Define `Credential` type (`types/credential.ts`)
- [x] **3.2** Define categories enum/map (`constants/categories.ts`)
- [x] **3.3** Vault metadata (version in blob; `lastUnlockedAt` on setup/unlock)

### Storage & crypto

- [x] **3.4** Master password flow (`setup-master-password`, `unlock`)
- [x] **3.5** Key derivation (PBKDF2-SHA256, 120k iterations) *(services/crypto/vault-crypto.ts — Run 4)*
- [x] **3.6** Encrypt vault blob at rest (AES-GCM via `@noble/ciphers`) *(Run 4)*
- [x] **3.7** Store encrypted blob + salt (AsyncStorage + SecureStore) *(Run 4; biometric key in SecureStore)*
- [x] **3.8** In-memory decrypted cache only while app is unlocked *(encryptionKeyRef cleared on lock — Run 4)*
- [x] **3.9** Auto-lock after 5 min backgrounding *(configurable preset enforced on AppState background→active — TASK-033)*

### CRUD & generator

- [x] **3.10** `VaultContext` for credentials
- [x] **3.11** Create, read, update, delete credentials
- [x] **3.12** Wire Vault screen to real list + search (client-side filter)
- [x] **3.13** Wire category chips to filter state *(shared CATEGORY_FILTERS + Dashboard→Vault param — Run 4)*
- [x] **3.14** Implement password generator service (`services/password-generator.ts`) *(Generator screen — Run 4)*
- [x] **3.15** Save generated password to new or existing entry *(Generator→Add Credential param — Run 4)*
- [x] **3.16** Wire Dashboard counts from real data
- [x] **3.19** Support multiple credentials for the same account/site (e.g. two Instagram logins with different passwords)
- [ ] **3.20** AI-assisted folders/tags for vault organization beyond fixed categories *(manual folder/tag filters done; AI deferred)*
- [x] **3.21** Advanced search by website, URL/domain, username, notes, category, and account label
- [x] **3.22** Credential password history for tracking previous passwords per account
- [x] **3.23** Favorite/archive account organization with dedicated My Space view and archived-excluded dashboard/health summaries

### Quality

- [x] **3.17** Unit tests for generator and crypto helpers
- [x] **3.18** Error handling: wrong master password *(GCM auth failure + corrupt-vault reset path + storage-full message — Run 4)*

### Definition of done

- User can unlock vault, add credentials, see them on Dashboard and Vault
- Data survives app restart (encrypted)
- Generator produces passwords matching selected rules

---

## Phase 4 — Password health

**Goal:** Meaningful health score and actionable insights.

### Tasks

- [x] **4.1** Password strength algorithm (`isWeakPassword`, generator strength)
- [x] **4.2** Detect reused passwords (in-memory compare while unlocked)
- [x] **4.3** Flag weak passwords below threshold
- [x] **4.4** Password age / “old password” warnings with optional user notifications
- [x] **4.5** Compute overall health score (0–100) in `computeHealthMetrics`
- [x] **4.6** Wire Health screen to live metrics
- [x] **4.7** Tap health issue → navigate to affected credential
- [x] **4.8** Show inline warnings on Vault rows (reused, weak) *(weak/reused/old badge pills on Dashboard + Vault — TASK-032)*
- [x] **4.9** Stronger duplicate-password warnings with grouped affected accounts and clear fix actions

### Future (Phase 4+)

- [x] Breach check via HIBP k-anonymity API (network, privacy review) *(Breach Monitor on Health — TASK-011; resolves D6)*

### Definition of done

- Health score updates when vault changes
- User can fix issues from health list via entry screen

---

## Phase 5 — Polish & release prep

**Goal:** Production-quality UX and store readiness.

### UX & accessibility

---

## Phase 7 — Premium UI overhaul (Fold-style)

**Goal:** Upgrade the existing app into a calm, responsive, premium experience inspired by Fold Money — without cloning it. Adopt the design philosophy (clarity, space, motion, depth, consistency), a centralized design-token system, a reusable UI kit, and a Reanimated-based motion + haptics layer. Migrate screens incrementally.

> This is a **parallel polish track**, not a v1 blocker. It can run alongside Phase 5 release prep. See the [Fold-style design tokens](#fold-style-design-tokens-phase-7) reference below for the values these tasks must use.

**Core principle:** A premium app is defined by how effortlessly the user moves through it — prefer simplicity over complexity, consistency over novelty, smoothness over speed, clarity over decoration. Keep every animation under **350ms**; users should feel a fast, elegant app without noticing the animations themselves.

### 7.1 Foundation — design tokens & theme

- [x] **7.1** Build the design-token system under `theme/`: `colors.ts`, `spacing.ts`, `radius.ts`, `typography.ts`, `shadows.ts`, `animations.ts` *(token layer under `src/theme/` + `getTheme(scheme)` barrel — Run 7)*
- [x] **7.2** 8-point spacing scale (`xs 4 · sm 8 · md 12 · lg 16 · xl 24 · xxl 32 · xxxl 48`) and radius scale (`chip 12 · button 16 · card 20 · sheet 24 · floating 28`) *(`theme/spacing.ts` + `theme/radius.ts` — Run 7)*
- [x] **7.3** Typography scale (Display 32/Bold · Heading 24/SemiBold · Title 20/SemiBold · Body 16/Regular · Caption 13/Medium · Label 11/Medium); max three weights, one font family *(`theme/typography.ts` — Run 7)*
- [x] **7.4** `useTheme` and `useHaptics` hooks; no screen defines its own colors/spacing/typography *(`src/hooks/use-theme.ts` resolves `getTheme(scheme)` + `src/hooks/use-haptics.ts` interaction map — Run 8)*

### 7.2 Core components (reusable UI kit)

Build under `components/ui/`; never duplicate UI logic, extract repeated patterns.

- [ ] **7.5** `Button` (scale to 0.98 on press, spring return, immediate visual + light haptic)
- [ ] **7.6** `Card` + `GlassCard` (radius 20, 20–24px padding, subtle shadow, elevated surface)
- [ ] **7.7** `Input` (themed, focus/error states)
- [ ] **7.8** `Avatar`
- [ ] **7.9** `AnimatedNumber` (count up/down instead of instant change)
- [ ] **7.10** `BottomSheet` (`@gorhom/bottom-sheet`, radius 24)
- [ ] **7.11** `SectionHeader`
- [ ] **7.12** `SkeletonLoader` (shimmer placeholder)

### 7.3 Motion design system

- [x] **7.13** Centralized animation durations in `theme/animations.ts` (tap 120 · button 180 · card expand 250 · navigation 300 · modal 350) *(+ easing/spring/stagger tokens — Run 9)*
- [ ] **7.14** Reanimated micro-interactions: button press, card fade+slide-up entrance + press elevation, list stagger (20–40ms) *(partial: `PressableScale` press + Dashboard fade-in/stagger — Run 9)*
- [x] **7.15** Haptic feedback map (press → Light · success → Success · error → Error · pull-to-refresh → Soft · card expand → Selection); avoid excessive vibration *(`hooks/use-haptics.ts` — Run 9)*
- [ ] **7.16** Skeleton → fade-in loading transitions (skeleton → fetch → fade out → fade content in ~200ms); never blank screens or content pop-in

### 7.4 Navigation experience

- [ ] **7.17** Floating rounded bottom navigation (soft shadow, active tab slightly larger, active icon accent / inactive muted)
- [ ] **7.18** Sticky headers that collapse slightly on scroll (no large fixed toolbars)
- [ ] **7.19** Fade + slide screen transitions with shared visual continuity

### 7.5 Screen migration & polish

- [ ] **7.20** Migrate screens one at a time to card-based layout + design tokens (Dashboard, Vault, Generator, Health, Settings, entry detail) *(partial: **Dashboard** migrated to tokens + premium card layout — Run 9; Vault/Generator/Health/Settings/entry pending)*
- [ ] **7.21** Background & depth pass: soft neutral background, subtle hero gradients, blur for floating elements, very light shadows (no heavy drop shadows / excessive glassmorphism) *(partial: Dashboard glow gradients + glass surfaces + light shadows — Run 9)*
- [ ] **7.22** Final UI consistency audit + animation-timing fine-tune (Design QA checklist: visual, motion, code, UX)

### Suggested libraries

| Purpose | Library |
|---------|---------|
| Animation | `react-native-reanimated`, `react-native-gesture-handler`, `moti` |
| Visual effects | `expo-blur`, `expo-linear-gradient` |
| UI / sheets | `@gorhom/bottom-sheet`, `react-native-svg`, `lucide-react-native` |
| Interaction | `expo-haptics` |

### Definition of done

- All buttons, cards, and inputs use shared UI-kit components and design tokens — no hardcoded colors/spacing/radius.
- Every interactive element gives immediate feedback (animation + haptic); animations stay under 350ms.
- Loading uses skeletons/shimmer with fade-in; no spinners, blank screens, or pop-in.
- Bottom nav, headers, and screen transitions follow the navigation experience spec.
- Design QA checklist passes for each migrated screen (visual quality, motion quality, code quality, UX).

---

## Phase 8 — Modern Animation & UX

**Goal:** Take the app from "polished" to "alive." Where Phase 7 established the calm token + motion *foundation*, Phase 8 layers on the **advanced, gesture-driven, physics-based motion and micro-interactions** that define best-in-class apps (Things, Linear, Arc, Revolut). Every interaction should feel direct, responsive, and reversible — driven by gestures and spring physics rather than fixed timers — while staying fully accessible and running at 60fps.

> This is a **second polish track** that builds directly on [Phase 7](#phase-7--premium-ui-overhaul-fold-style). It depends on the Phase 7 design tokens (`theme/animations.ts`, `useTheme`, `useHaptics`) and UI kit, and reuses the [Fold-style design tokens](#fold-style-design-tokens-phase-7). Not a v1 blocker.

**Core principles**

- **Gesture-first:** prefer interruptible, gesture-driven motion (drag, swipe, fling) over tap-then-wait animations; users should be able to reverse a gesture mid-flight.
- **Physics over timers:** use spring/decay physics for anything the finger touches; reserve fixed durations for non-interactive transitions.
- **Purposeful delight:** animation must communicate state, hierarchy, or spatial continuity — never decoration for its own sake.
- **Accessible by default:** every animation has a reduced-motion variant; nothing relies solely on motion to convey meaning.
- **Always 60fps:** all animation runs on the UI thread (Reanimated worklets); never block JS or thrash layout.

### 8.1 Gesture-driven interactions

- [ ] **8.1** Swipe-to-action vault rows (reveal copy / edit / delete) with spring snap, haptic detents, and full-swipe shortcut
- [ ] **8.2** Long-press → context menu + drag-to-reorder favorites (`react-native-gesture-handler` + Reanimated layout)
- [ ] **8.3** Custom branded pull-to-refresh (animated shield/progress, not the default spinner)
- [ ] **8.4** Velocity-aware bottom sheet gestures (snap points, fling-to-dismiss, backdrop fade with drag)

### 8.2 Shared element & screen transitions

- [ ] **8.5** Shared-element transition: vault row → entry detail (logo + title morph in place)
- [ ] **8.6** Scroll-driven collapsing headers with parallax hero (header shrinks/blurs as content scrolls)
- [ ] **8.7** Spatial continuity between Dashboard and Health (score/number morphs across screens)

### 8.3 Delight & feedback animations

- [ ] **8.8** Lottie / Reanimated success states (animated checkmark on save, copy-confirm pulse)
- [ ] **8.9** Animated empty-state illustrations (subtle looping motion, reduce-motion safe)
- [ ] **8.10** Generator strength meter: spring fill + color interpolation as strength changes
- [ ] **8.11** Health score ring draw-on animation synced with the count-up number
- [ ] **8.12** Subtle celebratory moment on health-score milestone (light confetti / glow, tasteful, dismissible)

### 8.4 Continuous & ambient motion

- [ ] **8.13** Perf-budgeted animated gradient / glow backdrops (slow drift, paused when offscreen)
- [ ] **8.14** Shimmer skeleton → content morph using Reanimated layout animations (no hard pop-in)
- [ ] **8.15** Spring-animated tab bar: active pill slides with spring, icon morph/scale on selection

### 8.5 Accessibility & performance

- [ ] **8.16** Respect `useReducedMotion()` — provide crossfade/instant variants for every motion above
- [ ] **8.17** 60fps budget: worklet-driven UI-thread animation, avoid JS layout thrash, profile with the perf monitor on a mid-range device
- [ ] **8.18** Motion consistency audit: all springs/durations sourced from `theme/animations.ts`; final timing + easing fine-tune and design QA

### Suggested libraries

| Purpose | Library |
|---------|---------|
| Gestures & physics | `react-native-gesture-handler`, `react-native-reanimated` (springs, `withDecay`, layout animations) |
| Shared transitions | Reanimated shared element transitions / `expo-router` transitions |
| Vector / Lottie | `lottie-react-native`, `react-native-svg` (animated paths for rings/strength) |
| Sheets | `@gorhom/bottom-sheet` |
| Effects | `expo-blur`, `expo-linear-gradient` |
| Feedback | `expo-haptics` |

### Definition of done

- Core lists and sheets are gesture-driven with spring physics and haptic detents; gestures are interruptible and reversible.
- Navigating into and out of an entry uses a shared-element / spatial-continuity transition.
- Success, loading, and empty states use purposeful animation instead of static UI or spinners.
- Every animation has a verified reduced-motion variant and conveys no information by motion alone.
- All animations hold 60fps on a mid-range device and source their timing/spring config from `theme/animations.ts`.

| Date | Phase / Milestone | Notes | Updated by |
|------|-------------------|-------|------------|
| 2026-06-14 | Phase 8 added (Run 14) | Added **Phase 8 — Modern Animation & UX**: 18 tasks across gesture-driven interactions (8.1–8.4), shared element & screen transitions (8.5–8.7), delight & feedback animations (8.8–8.12), continuous & ambient motion (8.13–8.15), and accessibility & performance (8.16–8.18), plus milestone **M6 — Living UI**. A second polish track that builds on Phase 7's tokens/UI kit toward gesture-first, physics-based, accessible 60fps motion. New scope: overall denominator → 168; overall → 49% (82/168); Pre-Phase 3 gate unchanged at 58%. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-14 | Phase 1 (1.9) remove Explore tab (Run 13) | Removed the default Expo starter **Explore tab** by deleting the unused `components/app-tabs.tsx` and `app-tabs.web.tsx` scaffolding (Home/Explore triggers + "Expo Starter" branding). No imports referenced them — the app uses the custom `BottomNav` — so no other code changed. Lint clean. Completed **1.9**. Phase 1 → 27% (3/11); overall → 55% (82/150); Pre-Phase 3 gate → 58% (28/48); M1 → 44%. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-14 | Phase 1 (1.4) route groups (Run 12) | Restructured `src/app/` routing to match the planned architecture: added **`(auth)`** group (onboarding `index` + `unlock` + `setup`), **`(tabs)`** group (dashboard/vault/my-vault/generator/health/settings with a nested no-animation stack `_layout`), and **`entry/[id]`** for credential detail/edit (replaces `/edit-credential`). Updated root `_layout.tsx` to reference the groups and repointed nav calls (`/edit-credential` → `/entry/[id]`). Route groups keep existing URLs, so the custom `BottomNav` and all `href`s still work; `add-credential`/`change-password` remain root routes. Completed **1.4**. Lint clean. Phase 1 → 18% (2/11); overall → 54% (81/150); Pre-Phase 3 gate → 56% (27/48); M1 → 40%. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-14 | Phase 1 (1.2) font decision (Run 11) | Decided to **keep the current fonts** instead of switching to Plus Jakarta Sans: system sans for body + **Playfair Display** serif headings (loaded via `@expo-google-fonts/playfair-display` in `app/_layout.tsx`). Updated the design-reference Font token and completed **1.2**. Phase 1 → 9% (1/11); overall → 53% (80/150); Pre-Phase 3 gate → 54% (26/48); M1 → 35%. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-14 | Phase 0 complete (Run 10) | Replaced the `securevault.zip` extraction task with the **`screenshots/`** folder as the read-only design reference (11 reference screens). Completed **0.4**; Phase 0 → 100% (6/6); overall → 53% (79/150); Pre-Phase 3 gate → 52% (25/48); M0 → 100%. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-14 | Phase 7 premium PoC (Run 9) | Evolved `src/theme` tokens to a **CRED-style premium blend** (deep aubergine bg, violet accent, new `glass` + `gradients` token sets resolved per scheme via `getTheme`). Added reusable `components/ui/PressableScale` (Reanimated press-scale + light haptic). Redesigned **Dashboard** as the proof-of-concept: glow-gradient backdrop, glass header/search, 3-stat summary card with count-up health score, premium category tiles, fade-in + staggered list entrances, gradient Security-Health hero, gradient FAB. Made `useTheme` dark-first so the look holds on light-mode devices. Completed **7.13** (motion durations) + **7.15** (haptic map); advanced **7.14/7.20/7.21** (partial). Lint clean; no new `tsc` errors. Phase 7 → 27% (6/22); overall → 52% (78/150); gate unchanged at 50%. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-14 | Phase 7 hooks (Run 8) | Completed **7.4**: `useTheme()` now resolves the full Fold-style token object from `src/theme/getTheme(scheme)`, and `useHaptics()` centralizes named interaction feedback (`press`, `success`, `warning`, `error`, `selection`, `pullToRefresh`, `cardExpand`). Updated starter themed helpers to consume `theme.colors`. `npm run lint` passes with one existing warning in `src/app/setup.tsx`; `npx tsc --noEmit` remains blocked by pre-existing starter tab/SymbolView type issues and missing Jest globals. Phase 7 → 18% (4/22); overall → 51% (76/150). | Cursor |
| 2026-06-14 | Phase 7 foundation (Run 7) | Built the Fold-style **design-token system** under `src/theme/`: `colors.ts` (light+dark neutral palette, semantic colors, brand `#5F61F6` accent), `spacing.ts` (8-pt scale + layout helpers), `radius.ts` (chip/button/card/sheet/floating/full), `typography.ts` (Display→Label scale, one family, ≤3 weights), `shadows.ts` (sm/md/lg subtle elevation), `animations.ts` (durations ≤350ms + easing/spring/stagger), and an `index.ts` barrel exposing `getTheme(scheme)` and a `Theme` type. Completes 7.1–7.3; lint clean, no new type errors. Phase 7 → 14% (3/22); overall → 50% (75/150); gate unchanged at 50%. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-14 | Phase 7 added (Run 6) | Added **Phase 7 — Premium UI overhaul (Fold-style)**: 22 tasks across design tokens (7.1–7.4), reusable UI kit (7.5–7.12), motion + haptics (7.13–7.16), navigation experience (7.17–7.19), and screen migration/polish (7.20–7.22), plus a Fold-style design-token reference and milestone M5. Parallel polish track inspired by Fold Money (clarity, space, motion, depth, consistency). New scope: overall denominator → 150; overall → 48% (72/150); Pre-Phase 3 gate unchanged at 50%. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-14 | Phase 2 UI verified (Run 5) | Verified 10 shipped Phase 2 tasks against real code: Dashboard greeting header, 6-category stat cards, Manage/Recently-Used sections, pill tab bar (2.2 ×4); Vault shield header, search, category chips, credential rows, security-alert card, empty states (2.3 ×6, import-stub deferred to Settings). Phase 2 → 61% (19/31); overall → 56% (72/128); Pre-Phase 3 gate → 50% (24/48); M1 → 30%. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-13 | Phase 3 encryption + Generator (Run 4) | AES-GCM at rest (3.5–3.8), legacy migration, categories map (3.2), category filter wiring (3.13), Generator tab (2.4/3.14/3.15), CRUD confirmed (3.11), error handling (3.18). Phase 3 → 96%; overall → 48%. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-13 | Phase 3–5 + Phase 4 complete (Run 3) | Biometric unlock (TASK-020/BUG-012), HIBP breach monitor (TASK-011, D6=Yes), brand logos + offline cache (W.7/TASK-006), custom logo upload (W.8/TASK-007), auto-lock (3.9/TASK-033), inline risk badges (4.8/TASK-032), screen-capture protection (5.7/TASK-035), loading/empty states (5.3/TASK-036), master-password change (TASK-034). Phase 4 → 100%; overall → 34%. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-13 | Phase 3–5 batch | Added Jest tests (3.17), rebuilt Password Health (4.1–4.4, 4.7, 4.9), clipboard auto-clear (5.8), JSON backup import/export (5.10–5.11), a11y pass (5.5), release metadata (5.12). Overall → 28%. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-13 | Phase 3 (3.22) | Password history captured on credential update with reveal/copy/restore UI in Edit Credential. Phase 3 → 48%. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-13 | Phase 3 (3.21, 3.23) | Completed Main Vault rebuild: shared-helper search (3.21/TASK-029), Active/Favorites/Archived filters + favorite toggle (3.23/TASK-021), copy-password rows (TASK-024), pressable security alert (BUG-009), left header branding (BUG-008), and nav-lock id routing (BUG-010). Phase 3 → 39%, overall → 13%. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-13 | Phase 0 docs | Documented offline-first v1 scope, styling/icon/state decisions, branch naming, and suggested labels in `README.md`; `securevault.zip` extraction remains open because the archive is not in the workspace. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-13 | Phase 3/4 exception | Started Phase 3/4 before the Pre-Phase 3 gate to clear P0 auth/vault-save bugs: added local vault setup/unlock, credential persistence/listing, duplicate-site support, route guards, and live health metrics. Full encryption remains pending. | Cursor |
| 2026-06-13 | Full reset | Audited current `src/` — UI-only prototype with no services/contexts/crypto. All 128 tasks reset to unchecked; progress 0%. | Cursor |
